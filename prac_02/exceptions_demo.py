CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# Question 1: Whenever the user trys to set numerator and denominator to a letter
# Question 2: Whenever the user sets the denominator to zero
# Question 3: Have a while loop until input is valid. Thus, keeps going over until the exception is fixed
